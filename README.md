# Weather App

A JavaScript weather app made using vanilla JavaScript and an API. 

The user can type in any location in the world and get the current weather data, as well as the forecast for the next few days. The user can also use the secondary "location" button to have the api fetch the data for their current location instead of typing in the name of their city. 

The app was designed in Figma and coded in HTML, SCSS & JavaScript and is responsive with a desktop and mobile design.
